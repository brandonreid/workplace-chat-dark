# workplace-chat-dark

Get a css injector plugin for your browser (here's one for [chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/css-and-javascript-inject/ckddknfdmcemedlmmebildepcmneakaa?hl=en)).

Inject the css and enjoy darkmode in Workplace Chat's fullscreen chat.

I maintain these styles with moderate aggression, so I'll try and post updates once in a while. 👍
